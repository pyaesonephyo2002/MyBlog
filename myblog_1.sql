Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data (represented as 0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits. Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition, allowing them to perform many calculations at once. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This unique capability enables quantum computers to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers, particularly in areas such as cryptography, optimization, and simulations of quantum systems. However, quantum computing is still in its early stages, with challenges in building stable qubits and improving error rates.', 10, 10, '2024-10-10 11:31:07');
